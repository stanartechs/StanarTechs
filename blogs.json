    "title": "World's first AI minister will eliminate corruption, says Albania's PM",
    "content1": "For government officials, being called \"heartless\" is an occupational hazard. But Albania has chosen to turn that insult into a positive quality, by appointing an AI minister.\n\nNot a minister for artificial intelligence. Rather, a cabinet member who is, literally, the work of AI.\n\nThe new addition is, like a pop star, known simply by the single name: Diella.\n\nPrime Minister Edi Rama introduced her as a member of his new cabinet on Thursday, four months after securing his fourth term in office in May elections.\n\nHowever, the move was symbolic rather than official, as Albania's constitution insists that government ministers must be mentally competent citizens aged at least 18. \n Still, the advantages of appointing a bot over a human are obvious. \nDiella, whose name means sun in Albanian, is unlikely to be the source of any unflattering leaks about the government. She will only be power-hungry in the sense of the electricity she consumes. And a damaging expenses scandal would appear to be out of the question. \nIn fact, corruption was uppermost in Rama's mind when he made Diella part of his team as minister for public procurement. Her role will be to ensure that Albania will become \"a country where public tenders are 100% free of corruption\".\"We're working with a brilliant team, which is not only Albanian but also international, to come out with the first full AI model in public procurement,\" the prime minister told the BBC. \"Not only will we wipe out every potential influence on public biddings – we will also make the process much faster, much more efficient and totally accountable.\" Diella had already been working in Albania even before the government \"appointment\". Her first incarnation was as an AI-powered virtual assistant, guiding applicants through the process to obtain official documents.",

    "title": "Larry Ellison briefly becomes world's richest person",
    "content1": "Elon Musk briefly lost his title as the world's richest person to Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle and an ally of US President Donald Trump. \n Ellison's wealth surged to $393bn (£290bn) on Wednesday morning, surpassing Musk's $385bn (£284bn), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. \n The jump came after shares in Oracle, which make up a significant part of Ellison's fortune, soared more than 40%, boosted by the database software company's surprisingly rosy outlook for its cloud infrastructure business and artificial intelligence (AI) deals. \n But the firm's share price had shed some of those gains by the end of the day, putting Musk back on top. Before briefly losing it to Ellison, Musk had held the title of world's richest person for nearly one year. \n He could receive a pay package worth over $1tn (£740bn) if he hits a list of ambitious targets over the next decade, the board of the electric car firm has proposed. \n But shares in Musk's most valuable business, Tesla, have fallen this yea.\n The electric vehicle maker has grappled with investor jitters over the Trump administration's rollback of electric vehicle initiatives, on top of consumer backlash to Musk's political involvement. \n Oracle has recently been propelled by growing demand for data centre infrastructure. \nThe company projected as part of its quarterly earnings report on Tuesday that revenue from its cloud business will jump 77% this year, to $18bn, with further growth expected in the coming years. \n Oracle has reported a surge in demand among AI companies for its data centres, which helped push its stock dramatically higher. \n It signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with customers in the last quarter and anticipates several more deals in the months ahead, chief executive Safra Catz said on Tuesday. \nTrump ties and media ambitions, Ellison, 81, helped start Oracle in 1977 and rose to prominence in the 1990s, when he became a public figure known as much for his lavish lifestyle as for the database company behind his fortune. \nHe was Oracle's chief executive until 2014 and is now the company's chairman and chief technology officer. \n And he has positioned himself as an ally to President Trump. \nWhen Trump returned to the White House in January, Ellison appeared alongside OpenAI's Sam Altman and SoftBank's Masayoshi Son to announce a project called Stargate, to build out AI infrastructure in the US. \nOracle has also emerged as a possible buyer of TikTok, the app owned by the Chinese internet company ByteDance. TikTok is facing a ban in the US unless it divests itself of its ByteDance ownership. \nIn January, when asked whether he was open to Musk buying TikTok, Trump responded: \"I'd like Larry to buy it, too.\"Ellison's media ambitions extend beyond TikTok. He funded the bulk of a $8bn bid by his son to acquire Paramount, which owns CBS and MTV. \nThat deal between Paramount and the media company Skydance, which is controlled by his son David, closed last month.",

    "title": "Why hackers are targeting the world's shipping",
    "content": "Lawyer Henry Clack sadly knows a lot about Nigerian criminal gangs. \nMr Clack, a solicitor at London-based commercial law firm HFW, has to deal with them when he is representing global shipping firms that have found themselves victims of cyber attacks.\n\"Of the cases which HFW have been involved in, the most common counterparties that we've encountered are Nigerian organised criminal organisations,\" he says. \"They have been responsible for perpetrating several high value 'man-in-the-middle' frauds in recent years.\n\"This type of fraud involves a hacker being able to intercept the communication between two parties, such as emails. The criminal then impersonates both in order to try to steal sensitive information, such as log-in details or financial data, or even to take control of a company's computer system.\nThe cyber criminals then demand money to give back what they have stolen, or to give up their command of a firm's computers. \nHFW's data shows that such hacking is a growing problem for the shiping sector, both attacks on ships and ports. It says that between 2022 and 2023 the cost of dealing with an attack doubled to an average of $550,000 (£410,000). \nMeanwhile, in cases where cyber security experts cannot easily remove the hackers, HFW says the average cost of a ransom payment is now $3.2m. Around 80% of world trade is carried by sea, and disruption can greatly increase shipping firms' costs, and leave them short of capacity. \nThis, says John Stawpert, manager for environment and trade in the marine department of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), makes the maritime industry a prime target for cyber attacks, from both criminal gangs and hostile countries. \n\"Cyber security is a major concern for the shipping industry, given how interconnected the world is. Shipping has been listed as one of the top 10 targets for cyber criminals globally,\" he says.\n\"The impact can be quite significant if cyber criminals manage to disrupt your operations or, for example, carry out a ransomware attack.\"And the rate of attacks is rocketing. A research group at the Netherlands' NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences compiled data on shipping cyber attacks over the last few years, and found that the number shot up from just 10 in 2021 to at least 64 last year. \nMany incidents, says Jeroen Pijpkerof the university's Maritime IT Security research group, are linked to the governments of four countries - Russia, China, North Korea and Iran.\n\"What we saw with one example was that equipment was being shipped to Ukraine, and then on a Telegram channel we see people giving information about what kind of targets to attack to get some kind of disruption in the logistical chain [of that delivery].\"Other attacks are purely for financial extortion, be it gangs from Nigeria or elsewhere.",

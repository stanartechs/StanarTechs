    "content": "People who spend more time looking at a screen in bed are more likely to report insomnia and sleep loss, a study has found. The research is based on a Norwegian survey of more than 45,000 students.It indicates that each additional hour of screen time was linked to a 63% increase in insomnia risk, and 24 minutes less sleep.However, the researchers said they had only established a correlation between screen use and lower sleep quality and had not demonstrated that the former caused the latter. Experts say putting down your phone before bed, doing something relaxing and establishing a routine may help improve sleep.",
